/**
 * Your task is to write unit tests for a "FizzBuzz" function.
 * These should include tests to ensure the function returns the number itself if it is not divisible by 3 or 5,
 * that it returns "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, that it returns "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, and that it returns "FizzBuzz"
 * if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. You should also consider writing tests for edge cases,
 * such as handling zero, negative numbers, and potentially invalid or non-integer inputs.
 * 
 * Please turn off any AI helping you with this task.
